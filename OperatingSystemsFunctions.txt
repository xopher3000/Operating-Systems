One of the most basic, but arguably the most important function of an operating system, is to start your computer or mobile device.
Upon starting your device, after the tests to run various hardware components are successful, the kernel of your device's operating system, as well as other instructions, are loaded into your devices RAM from it's internal storage area.
The kernel is memory resident and is the core of your operating system.
It manages just about everything your computer does such as running programs, assigning resources, managing its memory, and maintaining its inernal clock among other things.
